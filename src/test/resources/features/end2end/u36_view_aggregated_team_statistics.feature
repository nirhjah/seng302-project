#    Given I see the aggregated team statistics
#    And there are activities (game or friendly)  that have won, lost or drew overall,

#
#
#  Scenario: AC2: I can see a trend of the last 5 matches in terms of game and friendly won, lost and drew. Friendlies are visually distinguishable from games in that trend.

##  Left this out of e2e testing because it requires /populate_database to be run to add players to a team, but /populate_database only adds players to the first team available which causes issues for the tests. I have manually tested this AC instead
##  Scenario: AC3: I can see the names of the 5 top scorers with how many goals they scored overall.
##    Given There are at least 5 or more members of the team
##    And they all have scored in the activity
##    When I am viewing team aggregated statistics
##    Then I can see the top 5 scorers with how many goals they scored
##
##
##  Scenario: AC4: I can see the names of the 5 top players who played for the longest overall with their overall play time, and their average play time for a game.
##    Given There are at least 5 or more members of the team
